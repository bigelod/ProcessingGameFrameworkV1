This folder contains graphics you can use as part of your games (public domain!). Copy the PNG files or SVG files from this folder into the root folder and then import them in the code.

Remember to break sheets (multiple sprites in one image) into smaller images! also for PNG files try to keep all the animation frames in a sequence the same width and height (so add transparent space around smaller frames). Performance might also increase if you use textures that are a "power of two" eg: 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, 4096x4096. Some graphics cards can't render files larger than 4096x4096 though!

For more graphics, go to opengameart.org ! Remember to check the license as to whether credit is needed (not public domain) and if it can be used commercially (meaning you can sell games made with those graphics) if you plan to make a commercial game!
