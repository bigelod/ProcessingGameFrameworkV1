//Welcome to the MacGDA Multimedia Team Processing Game Framework (V1.0) !
//This is a 2D top-down game controlled with a mouse
//Tested in Processing 2.2.1 on Windows and MacOSX. If you have any issues, e-mail bigelod@mcmaster.ca

//=================
//Use these tabs to make your game the way you like:
//=================
//Audio -- Use this one to add your sound and music code in!
//GameLogic -- Use this one to add your game specific code in!
//GameObjs -- Use this one to add your object classes like players, enemies, items, etc
//HUDs -- Use this one to add a heads-up-display (HUD) for things like showing player health-points (HP) or the quit menu
//InputConfig -- Use this one for customising the controls of your game!
//Functions - Add your math functions here! try not to remove any you started with

//=================
//But try not to change these tabs, they are part of the engine/shared between the other projects and will be needed to merge the games into one compilation:
//=================
//THIS TAB! The only line you might be okay to change in this file is size(), where you can change Width, Height, and rendering engine (P2D or P3D, remove this part for old machines)
//Animation -- This is used to store a list of sprites an animate through them
//AnimationController -- This is used to store a list of animations and choose the right one
//Collisions -- This has useful code for detecting collisions which you can use in your GameLogic
//Input -- This controls the handling of input from keyboard and mouse
//Sprite -- This is a class for a sprite, or graphic image in games, including Backdrop (background) and Foreground (in-game) sprites
//Tools -- This contains useful functions and classes you can use in your game logic and objects!

//=================
//These are unused tabs / extra code you can use and hack around with and use how you like
//=================
//Functions3D -- This has some 3D functions from my "The Baby Is Coming" game on GameJolt

//=============================================================
//THIS CODE BELOW IS THE ENTIRE GAME ENGINE SETUP AND DRAW CODE! TRY TO KEEP THIS THE SAME SINCE WE SHARE IT BETWEEN ALL GAMES!!!
//=============================================================
